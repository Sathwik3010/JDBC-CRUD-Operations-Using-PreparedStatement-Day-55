we use prepared statement instead of statement because prepared statement is time saving than compared to statement method
in statement from java application  to database and again from database to java application total 4 pages should happen they are
 request time
 compile time
 execute time 
 response time

but in the case of prepared statement only 3 pages happen
 request time
 execute time 
 response time

where a lot of time saves
